# Counter
 GitHub Copilot: # Counter JavaScript Project  This project is a simple counter application built with JavaScript. It allows users to increment a count, save the current count, and reset the count to zero.  ## Features  - **Increment**: The `increment` function increases the count by one each time it's called. The updated count is then displayed on the screen. - **Save**: The `save` function saves the current count by appending it to a list of saved counts. It then resets the count to zero. - **Reset**: The `reset` function sets the count back to zero and updates the display accordingly.  This project is a great example of basic DOM manipulation in JavaScript. It's perfect for beginners looking to understand how to interact with web page elements using JavaScript.
